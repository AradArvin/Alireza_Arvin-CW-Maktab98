It came about that on a certain day Rustem arose from his couch, 
and his mind was filled with forebodings. 
He bethought him therefore to go out to the chase. 
So he saddled Rakush and made ready his quiver with arrows. 
Then he turned him unto the wilds that lie near Turan, 
even in the direction of the city of Samengan. 
And when he was come nigh unto it, he started a herd  
of asses and made sport among them till that he was weary 
of the hunt.Then he caught one and slew it and roasted it  
for his meal, and when he had eaten it and broken the  
bones for the marrow, he laid himself down to slumber,  
and Rakush cropped the pasture beside him.
